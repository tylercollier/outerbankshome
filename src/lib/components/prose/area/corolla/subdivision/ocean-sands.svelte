<p>Ocean Sands is an ocean front subdivision in Corolla that was designed to be a Planned Unit Development (PUD). This type of community planning allows the homes to be close together of small lots and still satisfy the lot coverage regulations by incorporating large open areas throughout the subdivision. SOme of these open areas are along the oceanfront which allows more homes to have ocean views. There is an active home owners association which takes care of the private roads and the community tennis courts and the  numerous beach accesses through out the community. You can find Ocean Sands just past the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/corolla/spindrift.asp" title="Spindrift">Spindrift</a> and before you get to the community of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/corolla/crown-point.asp" title="Crown Point">Crown Point</a>. </p>
