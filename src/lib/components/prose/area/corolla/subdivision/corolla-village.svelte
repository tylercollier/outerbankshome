<p>Corolla Village is where the Corolla phenomenon started. At one time it was a quaint fishing village where the residents eked out a living commercial fishing during the warm weather and guiding duck hunters during the winter months. Now that Corolla has became a vacation destination, Corolla Village has become just another subdivision amongst many. The roads in Corolla Village are all private and most of them are unpaved. With no active home owners association, the 95 property owners in Corolla Village have to chip in to keeps the roads maintained. You will find Corolla Village just past Corolla Light and before you get to The Villages at Ocean Hill. </p>
