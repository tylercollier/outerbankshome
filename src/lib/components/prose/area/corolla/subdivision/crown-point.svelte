		Crown Point is an oceanfront subdivision in Corolla with 90 building lots, most of which are already built on. The lots are large enough to hold a house and a pool, but if you are looking to buy a house and add a pool, then check to be sure the placement of the house on the lot does not preclude adding a pool. There is an active home owners association and the HOA fee is used to maintain the private roads, the clubhouse, pool and tennis court. You will find Crown Point just past the community of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/corolla/ocean-sands.asp" title="Ocean Sands">Ocean Sands</a> as you travel north on Rte 12 and just before you get to the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/corolla/buck-island.asp" title="Buck Island">Buck Island</a>.
