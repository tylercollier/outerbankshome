<div class="story"> <p>Chicahauk is a small subdivision of almost 500 building lots in Southern Shores that offers both dune living and a maritime forest environment. The high ridge line protects the area behind it allowing the growth of a maritime forest. The community has an active home owners association which manages the community tennis courts and beach access. There has been a lot of open area incorporated into the community including a protected cypress swamp for a very natural setting. </p>
