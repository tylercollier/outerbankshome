 <p>Snow Geese Dunes is comprised of 2 sections, Snow Geese North and Snow Geese South. Each section has approximately 39 lots, most of which are right around 10,000 sq ft in size, which makes it hard to get a pool on the lots. A new house designed with a pool in mind will work but adding a pool to an existing structure will be difficult unless the house is positioned on the lot just right so as to allow room for a pool. Snow Geese Dunes is located in Duck Just north of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/sea-ridge.asp" title="Sea Ridge">Sea Ridge</a> and south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/carolina-dunes.asp" title="Carolina Dunes">Carolina Dunes</a>. </p>
