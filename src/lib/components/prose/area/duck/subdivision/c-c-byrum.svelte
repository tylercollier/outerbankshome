<p>CC Byrum is a subdivision in Duck that runs from the sound to the ocean just past downtown Duck and close enough to walk to the shops and restaurants downtown. The community offers ocean and sound views depending on which side of the ridge you are standing. One private road, Olde Duck Rd, stretches from the sound to the ocean with 49 lots on either side of the road. The lots average 15,000+- sq ft which is large enough for a large house with an in ground pool. The Home Owners Association collects a modest fee to help with maintaining the beach and sound accesses, the sound access is a long pier out into the Currituck Sound for the owners and their guest.
