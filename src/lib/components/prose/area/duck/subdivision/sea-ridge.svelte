<p>Sea Ridge is a small subdivision with only 40 lots situated high on a ridge, hence the name, offering some panoramic views of the ocean and sound. The subdivision is architecturally controlled and each home  is different, each with their own unique architectural elements. The home owners association keeps the association fee down to a minimum even while maintaining an outdoor community pool, an ocean access, a sound access and the private roads that run through the community. The lots are large enough to hold large house with a pool.</p>
 <p>Sea Ridge is located in the middle of Duck, just north of the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/osprey.asp" title="Osprey">Osprey</a> and south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/carolina-dunes.asp" title="Carolina Dunes">Carolina Dunes</a>. Situated high up on a ridge which consists of  a series of sand dunes piled on top of each other, Sea Ridge offers a true beach experience from every home lucky enough to be there.</p>
