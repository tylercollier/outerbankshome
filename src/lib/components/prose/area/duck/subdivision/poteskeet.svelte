<div class="story"><p>Poteskeet Road winds through the subdivision of Poteskeet, from the ocean through the dunes and down to to Rt 12 in the heart of downtown Duck, with all of the shopping and dining found there. Don't confuse the subdivision of Poteskeet with the subdivision of 'Poteskeet Village', which is located just up the road, they are two distinct locales, each with their own set of restrictive covenants. Poteskeet does not have any amenities and there is a minimal association fee collected to help maintain the beach access and the private road. </p> <p> <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/poteskeet-covenants.pdf" title="Poteskeet Covenants">Poteskeet Covenants</a>     - - - <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/Covenant-Disclaimer.asp" target="_blank"><b>    *</b></a></p>
