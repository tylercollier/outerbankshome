<p>Caffey's Inlet Hamlet is a small ocean to sound community in <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/" title="Duck">Duck</a>, consisting of 45 building lots. The lots are large enough to hold a house with an in ground pool but with most of the lots already built on, you have to be careful if you want to add a pool. While the lot size is large enough, the house placement might get in the way of adding a pool. There is an active home owners association and they collect a small fee to cover the costs of maintaining the boardwalk at the ocean access, the pier at the sound access and the private roads. You can find Caffey's Inlet Hamlet just past the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/sea-tern.asp" title="Sea Tern">Sea Tern</a> heading north on Rt 12 and before you get to the community of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/sound-sea-village.asp" title="Sound-Sea Village">Sound-Sea Village</a>. </p>
