 <p>Sea Tern is a small subdivision of 28 lots, each ranging in size around 15,000 sq ft, which is large enough to hold a large house with a private in ground pool. There are no amenities so the HOA collects a small fee from the owners to maintain the beach access and the private road. Sea Tern is located in <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/" title="Duck">Duck</a> just north of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/port-trinitie.asp" title="Port Trinitie">Port Trinitie</a> and south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/caffeys-inlet.asp" title="Caffey's Inlet Hamlet">Caffey's Inlet Hamlet</a>.</p>
