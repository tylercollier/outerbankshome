<p>Up until 1990, Seapines was a campground where vacationers pitched their tents and cooked over fires. Now, it is an upscale community with houses in the million dollar plus range. The community pool, tennis court, roads and layout of the lots are the same as when it was a campground. There is an active Home Owners Association which takes care of the amenities including the private road. </p>
 <p>Seapines is made up of 60 individual lots, each large enough to hold a big house with an in ground pool.
