There are 2 sections in Sea Hawk, one on the oceanside of Rte 12 with 41 lots and the 2nd section on the westside of Rte 12 containing 34 lots. The lots are situated on either side of Sea Hawk Dr with a cu-de-sac at each end. each lot  just around 15,000 sq ft which is large enough to hold a house and pool but since most of the lots are already built you have to be careful if you want a pool. Not all of the houses were built with a pool in mind so they might not be situated on the lot in such a way as to accommodate the large area a pool requires. The lots on the north side of Sea Hawk Dr are in Sea Hawk and the lots ob the south side of Sea Hawk Dr are in Sea Hawk South. </p>
  <p>There are no amenities other than the beach access, no active Home Owners Association, and no HOA fees. The roads are private and if they ever need repairs the owners will have to work out an equitable system to get the work done. The subdivision of Sea Hawk can be found in the southern end of Duck just past the town of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/southern-shores/" title="Southern Shores">Southern Shores</a> , sandwiched in between <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/sand-dollar-shores.asp" title="Sand Dollar Shores">Sand Dollar Shores</a> and <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/tuckahoe.asp" title="Tuckahoe">Tuckahoe</a>. </p>
