<div class="story"> <p>Bias Shores is an ocean to sound community made up of 25 lots on the ocean side of Rte 12 and 31 lots on the soundside. The views range from open water sound to ocean depending on where you are. The section on the ocean side is relatively flat limiting any ocean view to the houses closest to the ocean. There is a little more elevation on the soundside offering sound views to more properties perched up higher. The lots are large enough to hold a large house with a pool and most of the existing houses already have pools. </p>
  <p>Bias Shores has has an active Home Owners Association which maintains the private roads, the pool, the 2 tennis courts, the sound access w/parking and the ocean access. You can find Bias Shores just past the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/ocean-crest.asp" title="Ocean Crest">Ocean Crest</a> as you are traveling north and just south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/tuckahoe.asp" title="Tuckahoe">Tuckahoe</a> in the southern end of Duck. </p>
