<p>Wild Duck Dunes is a small cu-de-sac subdivision of 32 lots, most of which are already built on. Located in one of the more vegetated areas in Duck, the private roads in Wild Duck Dunes are lined with naturally occurring live oak trees, a type of scrub brush that belongs to the oak family. Spanning the area between the ocean and the sound, home owners have access to the ocean. The HOA collects a small fee to help with maintaining the private roads. Wild Duck Dunes is one of the earliest subdivisions to be developed in Duck resulting in lots that are smaller than in some of the newer subdivisions. The lots are large enough to hold a pool, with good planning, so before you buy an existing house, check to be sure a pool will fit with the configuration of the house on the lot. Wild Duck Dunes is located in Duck just north of the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/north-point.asp" title="Northpoint">Northpoint</a> and south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/duck/port-trinitie.asp" title="Port trinitie">Port Trinitie</a>. </p>
