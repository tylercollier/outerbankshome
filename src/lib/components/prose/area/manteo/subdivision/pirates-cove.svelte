 <p>Named after Manteo, chief of the Roanoke Indians, Manteo is the County Seat of Dare County. At one time the protection of Shallowbag Bay made Manteo a prosperous port. As roads and bridges made their way to the Outer Banks the importance as a port waned and Manteo morphed into a quaint tourist destination.</p>
 <p>As you cross over the Roanoke sound on the Washington Baum bridge that connects Nags Heads and Roanoke Island you will see a Pirates Cove subdivision on your right. Continue on down Rte 158 and you will come to an intersection. Turn left and you will end up in Wanchese, turn right and you will be on your way to Manteo.</p>
 <p>Traveling north on Virginia Dare Road you will see the entrances to College of the Albemarle and the Peninsula on your right and the Dare County Justice Center on your left. Moving along you come to Collins Creek and Shallowbag Bay Condos on your right and across the street is subdivision of Vista Lake.</p>
 <p>If you turn right just past the Manteo Middle School you will end up in down town historic Manteo. Here you will find&amp;nbsp;picturesque  tree and shop lined  streets, the Elizabeth II replica 16th century sailing ship and the  Roanoke Island Festival Park surrounding the Manteo waterfront. Well worth a day trip.</p>
 <p>North of the town you will find the Lost Colony outdoor drama, Fort Raleigh National Monument and the Manteo Airport. <a href="Http://www.manteo.govoffice.com/" target="_blank" >Town Of Manteo</a></p>
