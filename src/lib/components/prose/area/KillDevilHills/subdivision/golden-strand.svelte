<div class="story"> <p>FYI, there are some units in this community that were originally sold by the developer as time share units. You will not notice this in any way except when it comes to financing. At times, some lenders are reluctant to make loans in a complex that has some time share ownership. Before you fall in love with one of these units, inquire about the availability of financing, preferably ask a local OBX lender or a Shore Realty agent as out of town lenders will be unfamiliar with this type of situation, and some real estate agents just don't know about it. </p>
