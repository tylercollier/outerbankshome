 <p>Wright's Shores is a fairly large subdivision, by OBX standards, with approximately 250 individual properties stretching from the bypass to the bay between 4th and 5th streets. The lots are on the smaller side so you won't find a lot of in ground pools here. There is a deeded  access to Kitty Hawk Bay on Bay Dr. and a deeded oceanfront access and parking area at the east end of 5th St. for the owners and guest of Wright's Shores. You can find Wright's Shores just south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/KillDevilHills/avalon-beach.asp" title="Avalon Beach">Avalon Beach</a> and north of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/KillDevilHills/sea-holly-ridge.asp" title="Sea Holly Ridge">Sea Holly Ridge</a>. </p>
