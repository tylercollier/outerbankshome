<p>Old Nags Head Cove is one of the few waterfront communities on the Outer Banks that is boater friendly. The western most houses are  waterfront with wide open views of the Roanoke Sound. About one half of the properties are on salt water canals that go out into the sound. These canals are popular with boaters which makes Old Nags Head Cove popular with vacationers. The rest of the property wraps around a vestige of Jockey's Ridge sand dune. </p>
 <p>The population in the Cove is a little less than 1/2 year round residents with the rest being second homes that some owners rent out to summer vacationers. Old Nags Head Cove is located in the middle of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/" title="Nags Head">Nags Head</a> just north of the <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/village-at-nags-head.asp" title="The Village at Nags Head">Village at Nags Head</a> on the westside of the big road. There is a sound front clubhouse and swimming pool and a private boat ramp for the use of owners and their guests.</p>
