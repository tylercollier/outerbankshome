<p>Nags Head Pond is a fairly new subdivision that is centered around a man made pond. The pond was actually made when they built the old Surf Slide water park. They dug a hole to get enough sand to make a hill big enough to hold the water slide. The slide is long gone and roads were put in around the pond and the land was subdivided into 37 residential lots. The population is almost all year round residents. </p>
	<p>The back of Nags Head Pond borders Nags Head Woods which belongs to the <a href="http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/northcarolina/placesweprotect/nags-head-woods-ecological-preserve.xml" title="Nature Preserve">Nature Preserve</a>.
