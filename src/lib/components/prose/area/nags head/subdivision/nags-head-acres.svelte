<p>Located on the west side or Rt. 158 in Nags Head, Nags Head Acres is one of the more traditional neighborhoods. The ground elevation is high enough so that it is in a Flood Zone X which means that you do not have to have flood insurance and you can build your house on the ground. You will not find many houses in Nags Head Acres that are built up on pilings like most of the houses on the Outer Banks. The population here is almost all year round residents. There are 141 lots most of which are already built on. You will find Nags Head Acres just south of the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/nags-head-pond.asp" title="Nags Head Pond">Nags Head Pond</a> and north of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/vista-colony.asp" title="Vista Colony West">Vista Colony West</a>. </p>
