<p>Dunes South is a small complex of townhouses located on the ocean side of Rte 12 in <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/" title="Nags Head Homes for sale">South Nags Head</a>. It is a Planned Unit Development (PUD) consisting of 16 buildings with 2 duplex units in each building for a total of 32 townhouses. The community shares a tennis court and an ocean front pool. All of the units have just a very short walk to the beach with no roads to cross. Located just south of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/yaupon-beach.asp" title="Yaupon Beach">Yaupon Beach</a> and adjacent to the <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/eighteen-south-condos.asp" title="Eighteen South Condos">Eighteen South Condos</a>.</p>
	<p>FYI, there are some units in this community that were originally sold by the developer as time share units. You will not notice this in any way except when it comes to financing. At times, some lenders are reluctant to make loans in a complex that has some time share ownership. Before you fall in love with one of these units, inquire about the availability of financing, preferably ask a local OBX lender or a Shore Realty agent as out of town lenders will be unfamiliar with this type of situation, and some real estate agents just don't know about it. </p>
