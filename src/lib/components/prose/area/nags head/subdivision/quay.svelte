<p>The Quay Condos are located on the Oceanfront in <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/" title="Nags Head">Nags Head</a> and they all have 3 bedrooms, 3 full baths, oceanfront balconies, and were built before the reverse floor plan became popular. A reverse floor plan has the living area and kitchen on the top floor to maximize the views. After all, this is were  people spend most of their time. </p>
	<p>In the Quay, you will find the kitchen, living area, 1 bedroom and a bath located on the first floor. From the first floor level the view is the back of the dunes that line the beach. This is not a bad view but it is not ocean view. The best ocean view is available only from the master bedroom which is located on the top floor. On the ground level you will find a dry entry, storage area and covered parking. The complex boasts an oceanfront pool and tennis and is in walking distance to a number of restaurants and shopping. You can find the Quay just north of the <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/village-at-nags-head.asp" title="Village at Nags Head">Village at Nags Head</a> and across from <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/moongate.asp" title="Moongate">Moongate</a>. </p>
