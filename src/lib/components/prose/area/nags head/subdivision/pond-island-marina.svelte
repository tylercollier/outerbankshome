<p>Pond Island Marina is one of the few boating friendly communities in Nags Head. It is also one of the few places on the Outer Banks where you can have a house on the soundfront and keep your boat in protected water out back. All of the homes have water views from the front and back and this is truly a water paradise. </p>
