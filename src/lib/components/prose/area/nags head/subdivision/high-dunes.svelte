<p>High Dunes is a smallish subdivision in South Nags Head consisting of roughly 60+ properties bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean , on the west by the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and to the north is  <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/chawanook-cay.asp" title="Chawanook Cay">Chawanook Cay</a> and to the south is the subdivision of <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/outer banks/real estate/nags head/northbank.asp" title="Northbank">Northbank.</a> Over the years, the oceanfront section of High Dunes has taken a real hit from ocean erosion. Most of the home on the oceanfront row have  washed away or have been abandoned and removed. Some of the current homes fronting the ocean used to be second row homes, at one time located across the street from the ocean but as the oceanfront homes went away these second row homes became oceanfront. If you find what appears to be a really good deal on a home located on Surfside Dr in South Nags Head, please take heed and ask a lot of questions. </p>
