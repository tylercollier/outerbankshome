				As  first time sellers, Terry and Greg made the whole process very easy.  There was just the right amount of communication and explanation.  Except for sending a notarized document through the mail, all other  transactions and document signings were done electronically. We were kept  in the loop throughout and it seemed like ours was the only piece of property  that Shore Realty was dealing with. That is how personalized the service was.<br />Neil &amp; Laura from  NC

				Terry Cremia is THE best Realtor we have ever had! My husband and I bought our first house with  Shore Realty nearly 8 years ago as Maryland residents. Five purchases and 1  sale later, we now live in Nags Head and are STILL working with Terry. She is the ultimate professional. Terry continues to provide us with all the  information we need to make informed, intelligent real estate decisions. She is thorough, knowledgeable, and expedient  at answering our questions. Better yet,  Terry anticipates our questions and provides valuable information regarding the  market, its trends, and various other components that will affect real estate  transactions. She is friendly, funny, and always responsive to our needs. Choose Shore Realty and you&rsquo;ll be glad you  did!<br />Barry &amp; Debbie  from NC

				Shore Realty made our first real  estate sales transaction a positive experience. Terry and Greg offered expert  advice and worked hard to guide us through the process. They were recommended  to us by previous neighbors, and we would recommend them to others.<br />

				Shore Realty was a joy  to work with from professionalism to pleasure. They got the job done and  we were very happy to have made that choice. I would recommend Terry and  Greg in a hearts beat to list and sell your home or act as your agent  otherwise. <br />Dan &amp; Gay from PA

				I needed a Realtor to sell on the OBX, the best thing that  happened was Terry took charge and quickly had a buyer for me. There was  excellent communication and since I was not local that was important to me.    She was expedient with all documents and deadlines. The transaction went smooth  and painless. I would use her again<br />
				and recommend her to others.<br />Paul from VA

				I appreciated the professional and immediate service provided by  Terry Cremia in purchasing my condo at Kill Devil Hills. Terry was able to  meet me a couple times with little notice. Also, Terry streamlined the purchasing process,  minimizing the usual stress associated with inspections and legal process.<br />

				I used Shore Realty to sell my house. They were the  ultimate professionals and were in constant communication with me. Terry went  over and beyond to make me feel secure in the whole process. My home was sold  within two weeks. I referred my cousin to them and they sold 2 homes for her in  2 weeks. Best realtors I have ever worked with!! I would recommend them to  anyone.<br />Jeanne from NC

				We recently sold our property in   Kill Devil Hills in 20 days, thanks to the highly professional work of Greg   Cremia &amp; Terry Rush. They were open to our suggestions but we took their advice and were able to close the deal quickly and smoothly. They kept us well informed on the negotiations and always returned our calls promptly when we had any questions.   We would certainly recommend them to anyone buying or selling on the Outer Banks. <br />

				My husband and I first met Greg Cremia 8 years ago when we were looking for an agent to help us find our first &quot;beach   house.&quot; We signed on with Greg and never looked back! The house we purchased was   under construction, and I will never forget the service Greg provided...much   more than expected from any real estate agent. He monitored progress of the   construction and kept us informed. This was invaluable as he noticed the   wainscot material being used was not what we specified and we were able to speak   with the contractor and get this corrected in a timely manner. After we moved   in and began rentals Greg checked on the house to make sure it was being   adequately cleaned. Have you ever heard of an agent that went that far in   providing service to his clients? I have not even mentioned the help Greg was in   having water, power and phone service started. In these past 8 years Greg has   assisted us in either the purchasing or selling of 8 properties, and we could   not be more pleased with his services. This is definitely the agent you want,   particularly if you live out of the area and need &quot;eyes, ears and legs&quot; on site! <br />

				We have worked with Greg for over 10 years and have developed a very healthy respect for his knowledge, business acumen and skills. From the purchase of our first rental home through the sale   of an Outer Banks property, both Greg and Terry have been outstanding partners.   They know the business, the area and, most importantly, how to interact and have   a productive relationship with everyone with whom they come in contact. If you   are looking for knowledgeable, personable and truly involved individuals to conduct your real estate business on the Outer Banks, you won't find a better team than Greg and Terry.<br />

				When we called RE/MAX, my husband   and I thought we had a pretty solid idea of what we wanted and familiarity with   the area we here we were looking. We just needed an agent to close the deal.   Turns out that the knowledge and advice offered by both Greg and Terry guided us   through a couple of sticky situations resulting in thousands of dollars saved,   and ultimately, out total satisfaction with the deal. They have a life history   of local knowledge; they are fun and relaxed; and they have the integrity and   honesty that is sometimes a gamble in resort areas. We will return to Terry and   Greg for our next investment, and we will list our holdings with them as well.<br />

				After selling our home in Maryland   through RE/MAX, naturally when we went to look for a vacation home, we looked   for a RE/MAX office on the Outer Banks. Searching the internet long distance   from Arizona, we came upon Terry Rush. She communicated with us regularly and   sent us listings. Even through Hurricane Isabel, we stayed in contact. Greg and   Terry acting as buyer brokers on our behalf helped to make our home purchase   smooth and efficient. Thanks!<br />

				We just purchased our first beach   house and, with Terry and Greg's help, it was the easiest, most pleasant   experience. They went out of their way to help in this long-distance   transaction. We would definitely work with them again. Really A++++ people.<br />

				Greg Cremia and Terry Rush make a   fantastic team! They really understand the real estate market and bring years of   experience and knowledge to both the buying and selling process. They stayed in   touch with us continuously and assisted us through every step in the purchasing   process. As buyers from out of town, we received continual help from them in   setting up utilities and securing local inspectors so we could move into our   home immediately. Would we recommend them to local or out of town buyers and   sellers? Absolutely! <br />
