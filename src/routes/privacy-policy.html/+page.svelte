		<p>The PRIVACY POLICY of  Shore Realty of the Outer Banks, Inc. is as follows. All personal information that we collect such as your name, address,  email address, or phone number is treated like gold nuggets. Too valuable to let any get away and hoarded away like some kind of treasure. </p>
		<p>
			At times we have to collect such information in order to be able to provide you with <a href="new-listing-notifier.html" title="Automatic email updates of new listings">Automatic email updates of new listings</a>, or <a href="your-homes-value.html" title="Your Home's Value">Your Home's Value</a>.
		</p>
		<p>The rest of the time, including when you search all the real estate for sale on the OBX, you are free to anonymously roam our web sites. </p>
		<p>We do  not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or other companies. No exceptions. If you give us your name, address,  email address, or phone number you can be sure that it will not be used by anyone other than Shore Realty of the Outer Banks, Inc.</p>
		<p>This policy has 2 purposes. First is to protect you from receiving solicitations that you did not request and second, in the highly competitive field of real estate sales there is fierce competition. A potential client's information is worth it's weight in gold and there is no way Shore Realty of the Outer Banks, Inc. is  going to share it with anyone else. Can it get any simpler than that?</p>
