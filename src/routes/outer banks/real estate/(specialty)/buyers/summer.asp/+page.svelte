	<h2 align="center" id="pageName">Summer Real Estate Season </h2>
	<div class="feature">

		<p> Once the  the summer vacation season arrives it becomes much harder to look at homes for sale. Vacation rental beach houses are likely to have renters in them. It is up to the renters as to whether we are allower inside while they are on vacation. So, the only time they are available to see rental homes is between 10am and 2pm on checkout day. </p>
		<p>Checkout day is also check-in day, we call it turnover day, and inbetween renters is  the only opportunity we have to look at vacation rental houses in the summer. Looking at homes for sale is still possible we just have to plan around this time frame. </p>
		<p>With only a 4 hour time frame to look at houses and travel times double because of the congestion you need to plan ahead. This is not the time of year to look at a bunch of houses spread out all over the Outer Banks. Plus if the renters have the house booked for 2 weeks then you won't be able to see it until they check out. Please call ahead to make arrangements so we can have everything set up to run smoothly. </p>
		<p> Don't forget about the traffic. The trip to the Outer banks can take considerably longer with all of the summer traffic. Don't expect to drive here in the record time you made in May. The delays can be extensive and we will be on a strict timetable due to the renters trying to check in. </p>
		<p>Here on the Island the locals try to not make left hand turns during the summer. We actually arrange our showings to take so we don't have to turn left. Right hand turns moving up the beach and then right hand turns coming back down the beach. Recently it took me 2 hours to get from Corolla to Kill Devil Hills on a Saturday in July and there wasn't an accident and I waited until everyone had checked out before I made the trip.</p>
		<p>
			The summer time is a good time to drive around and learn the different neighborhoods and what your money will get you in the different areas of the beach. Call ahead and we can send you a <a href="https://www.outerbankshome.com/just-listed.html" title="list of homes for sale">list of OBX homes for sale</a> in your price range so you can take some time and explore the OBX for what might someday be your dream beach house. <a href="tel://2524413416">252-441-3416</a> OR <a href="tel://8006471868">800-647-1868</a>
