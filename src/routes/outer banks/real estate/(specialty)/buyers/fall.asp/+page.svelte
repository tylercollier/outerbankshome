	<h2 align="center" id="pageName">Fall Real Estate Season </h2>
	<div class="feature">
		
		<p>In the fall the sellers have collected all of the summer's rental income. There will be no more rental income until next year and no help paying the bills over the winter. This is when a seller is in their best position to make a deal. </p>
		<p>The prospect of nothing but expenditures for the next 4-5 months sometimes makes a seller open to options that they wouldn't have been in the late spring when they were looking at the prospect of lucrative income for the next 4-5 months. </p>
		<p>Rental houses are easier to see, especially later in the fall, because of the absence of vacationers. Seeing rental properties is often possible mid-week, not just on turnover days. Beach is beautiful and weather is mild, ocean water is still warm even during the days it is cool outside. </p>
		<p>Buyers looking to turn fixer-uppers into rental properties have the entire winter and spring to do remodeling and be ready for the next summer rental season. </p>
		<p>The traffic also eases up so getting to the houses is not the big project it is during the simmer. </p>
		<p>You can easily find a motel to stay for one or two nights and some of the houses are offering 3 night stays in the fall and because there are still a number of visitors the restaurants and most of the stores are open. After the tourists have gone home for the summer the beach slows down to a less hectic pace and the service in the restaurants gets better as the employees are not slammed all the time. </p>
